# Darli USD Whitepaper
Darli USD (USDD) is a decentralized, USD-pegged stablecoin built on the Solana blockchain that enables SOL holders to access instant, interest-free liquidity by locking collateral in open-source lending protocols, starting with Save protocol. The protocol is governed entirely by the Darli DAO, with parameters and upgrades controlled by Darli Governance Token (DRL) holders through the Realms DAO framework. Users can borrow USDD against SOL collateral at a minimum collateral ratio (MCR) of 110%, with all operations—minting, liquidation, and governance—executed entirely on-chain via smart contracts. Darli USD is designed to be censorship-resistant, fully transparent, and free from centralized administrative control.
